# Working Effectively and Efficiently

We highly recommend you do the following:

* In your codespace you will want to open 2 terminal tabs::
  * One will be for executing terminal commands and using the Rails console.
  * One will be for running your server, so you can test your app as you code (you can't use the terminal for anything else when the server is running).
* Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.
  * Bring up one window with two tabs
    * One for this content
    * One for interacting with your app.
* Open your text editor and don't close it.
* Hide all extra applications. Turn off Twitter, Facebook, IM, and all other distractions.

By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
browser gets confusing.
