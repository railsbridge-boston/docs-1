### Goal

To teach you Ruby on Rails we are going to use a "Real World"
example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your
friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to
allow users to:

* view the topics sorted by number of votes
* vote on topics
* create, edit, and destroy topics

You've sketched up an initial screenshot of what you want it to look like:

![Browser window with topic titles that can be voted on, ordered by number of votes](img/finished_app.png)

### Meta-Goal

When you have completed today's goal of getting the basic
application online you should understand:

* Basic Ruby syntax
* How to try your Ruby code (IRB)
* How to go from requirements to a new working Rails application
* How to get your application online
* The basic tools a RoR (Ruby on Rails) developer uses (source control, editor, console, local server)

### Schedule

* 1-ish hour of Ruby
* 4-ish hours of Rails, broken up in 1-ish hour steps

This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go
over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the
day. Probably.

### Requirements

To get through this course, you'll need a free Github account.

<a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">Create a free Github account</a> by filling the signup form.

On the next screen, you can click "skip personalization" on the bottom to continue.<br>
<img class="screenshot" src="./img/codespaces2.png" />

<p>
    Once you are signed into Github, you'll need to create a <strong>repository</strong> - a new programming project. <br><br>
    To do that,
    <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/start/generate" target="_blank">Create a new repository</a> from the Railsbridge template.
    You can pick any name you like, or accept the default suggestion. You can also decide if you want your code to be public
    for anyone to see, or private. <br><br>Leave the "Include all branches" option unchecked, then click <strong>Create repository</strong>.<br>
    <img class="screenshot" src="./img/codespaces5.png" />
</p>
<p>
    It may take a moment for your repository to be generated.<br>
    <img class="screenshot" src="./img/codespaces6.png" />
</p>
<p>
    When it's finished, you'll be taken to a page that looks like this. Click on the green <strong>Code</strong> button,
    then click <strong>Create codespace on main</strong>. This will be our code editor.<br>
    <img class="screenshot" src="./img/codespaces7.png" />
</p>
<p>
    This will begin setting up the editor in your browser. It may take a minute or two.<br>
    <img class="screenshot" src="./img/codespaces8.png" />
</p>
<p>
    The editor will automatically set up like this once it's ready.<br>
    <img class="screenshot" src="./img/codespaces9.png" />
</p>

<p>
    Congratulations! You're ready to start coding.
